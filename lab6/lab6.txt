Strong interferer 
	>>even though trying to demodulate different signals, but gets saturated

Memoryless:
	>>depends only on current input

Second Non-linearity : DC  + second harmonic
Third : first harmonic + third harmonic

IM: intermodulation components, f1-f2, f1+f2, 

IIP2 : if we interpolate non linear components as we increase the inputs, when the two powers are equal, 
second order non linear narrow band systems: non linear generates out of bands signals only, if wide band, then (Obvio)

Third order : 
	in addn to harmonics; 2f1 - f2, 2f1 + f2, 2f2 and so on

IIP3 and OIP3 is used to quantify the non linearity

Qualitatively : second order non linearity, second and dc components, 
third order, part of the distortion is generated in band, can't be removed

third order for narrow band is particularly important

If we have a strong interferer, amplifier saturates, a3 is usually negative, the overall gain gets compressed, if amplifier saturates, the gain will go down

Receiver is jamming, generate a high power signal

if we increase the fundamental factor by c then second, higher components increase at a much higher rate. 

a strong interference saturates. 

suppose initially square, but then we observe some curves around it, implies strong non linearity, we need to decrease the gain, so as to receive less power

if broadened spectrum, then may need to decrease the power
